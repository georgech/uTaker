The FT800 emulator from FTDI is supplied as VS 2012 and VS 2015 versions.
Copy the corresponding library file from one of the sub-foldere to here in case a different version is needed.
Take the ft8xxemu.dll file from the appropriate sub-directory and copy it to the simulator's working directory to ensure that its can be found at run-time (eg. copy to \Applications\uTaskerV1.4\Simulator\uTasker___Win32_uTasker_Kinetis_build)
