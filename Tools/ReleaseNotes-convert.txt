Version V1.4 original
=====================

"uTaskerConvert -v" to get the version number.

This utility is used mainly to convert a binary input file, linked to an address suitable for operation with the
uTasker boot loader, to an uploadable file which is recognised by the BM-boot loader.

Use 1: "uTaskerConvert file1.bin file2.bin -0x22ba -b267a8200926"

File1 is converted to file2 by adding a header containing details of its length and CRC16 check sum. The magic number 0x22ba is
used to identify the project that the code is related to (it can be any 16 bit hex value). The key -b267a8200926 is used as an
encryption key to ensure that only code converted using the project key (this can be up to 100 hex bytes long) is recognised as
valid code by the boot loader

Use 2: "uTaskerConvert file1.bin file2.bin -0x22ba -b267a8200926 -ab627735ad192b3561524512 -17cc – f109"

ab627735ad192b3561524512 is an encryption key which is used to transform the data content. It must have a length dividable by 4) 
and its length determines the strength of the coding.
17cc is used to prime a pseudo-random number generator used during the process (should not be zero) which must also match.
F109 is a shift value in the code which makes it much more difficult to break using brute-force techniques. Without this shift
it would be much easier to match known code patterns at the start of the file. Since the start code can be anywhere in the data
this avoids this possible weakness.

Version V1.5 4-12-2010
=======================

Allows use with no key specified.



Version V1.6 14-05-2011
=======================

Added capability to convert Motorola binary to raw binary output. This is useful for CodeWarrior binary output
which can otherwise not be used directly as a code image - after the conversion the content is in raw binary format
and so suitable for general binary program use.

Use "uTaskerConvert uTasker_BM.bin raw.bin -b"

Version V1.7 01-10-2013
=======================
Version 1.7 increase the maximum target size from 512k to 1M


Version V1.8 24-04-2014
========================
Version 1.8 increase the maximum target size from 1M to 2M


Version V1.9 09-06-2014
========================
Version 1.9 allow encryption offset values larger than the file length

Version V1.10 02-10-2015
========================
Version 1.10 protect against motorola to raw binary conversion when (invalid) 0xffffffff length block is found
